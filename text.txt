Dear Mr. Bradman,

My name is Zoe Hooper, and I am writing to show my interest in a scholarship for your Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. I have a passion for helping people, and I hope my financial limitations will not hold me back from harnessing this passion in my career.

I grew up in a lower-income family with a single mother who worked three jobs to provide for my brothers and me. My mother taught me the value of hard work and the importance of taking care of others who cannot take care of themselves. She also stressed the importance of education to us, teaching us that it would help us access an easier life. Her encouragement along with my own determination helped me earn some of the best grades in my high school class.

As my mother worked long hours, I spent a lot of time caring for my youngest brother who has cerebral palsy. I feel the time I spent caring for him sparked an interest in nursing. I learned to be compassionate and patient and was rewarded by his smiles. I hope to make my own patients smile in the face of their own health concerns in the future.

I feel my natural work ethic and drive to succeed would make me an asset to Los Angeles University. I know your school has an excellent nursing program, and feel it would give me the perfect environment to gain the degree I need to secure my dream job and give back to the community. Rest assured that I would make the most of the scholarship opportunity and make you and my mother proud.

I am very grateful for the time you have taken to consider my application and look forward to hearing from you soon. Please do not hesitate to contact me at zoe.hooper@email.com if you have any questions about my application.

Kind regards,

Zoe Hooper
